    "Character Descriptions": "- Hestia: A serene and wise goddess, traditionally dressed in a flowing white gown, Hestia values stability and fears change. She is initially motivated by her duty to Zeus and the traditional roles of women, but as she encounters the modern world, she experiences an internal conflict between her loyalty to Zeus and her growing sympathy for Elara's cause. Her transformation is marked by her gradual acceptance of modern values and her eventual decision to support Elara in her fight for gender equality.\n- Elara: A passionate and eloquent protester, dressed in modern attire, Elara is driven by her belief in justice and equality. She is a feminist who is protesting for equal pay and is initially skeptical of Hestia's presence. However, as she engages with Hestia and shares her personal stories of struggle, she learns the value of tradition and patience. Her interactions with Hestia lead her to appreciate the importance of balancing modern values with the wisdom of the past.\n- Zeus: The authoritative and traditional king of the gods, Zeus is initially confident in his directive to Hestia to influence women in New Athens. As Hestia begins to stray from her directive and align with Elara's cause, Zeus becomes increasingly impatient and frustrated.
