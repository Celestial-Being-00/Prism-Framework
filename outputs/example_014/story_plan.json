    "Character Descriptions": "- **Joseph**: A man of intricate contradictions, Joseph appears confident and sophisticated on the surface, a mask he dons to mask his deep-seated insecurities and fear of intimacy. His ambition and greed are fueled by a past riddled with failure and a yearning for acceptance. His deceptive marriage to Nima is a calculated move to secure his financial future, yet as his facade slips, his controlling and domineering personality comes to the forefront, revealing a man who is as much a prisoner of his own lies as he is a perpetrator.\n- **Nima**: Nima is a quiet and intuitive young woman who carries the weight of her Annishinabe heritage with grace and pride. Her traditions and values are important to her, yet she is also acutely aware of the vulnerability that her youth and her cultural background can entail. She is not merely a passive victim of Joseph's deception; she is guarded and strong, with a hidden resilience that will ultimately allow her to confront Joseph and reveal her true, enigmatic identity.",
    "Setting": "The story unfolds in the picturesque yet culturally complex landscape of rural Minnesota during the late 1920s. The setting is a microcosm where the old ways of the Annishinabe people meet the encroaching forces of modernity. The church where the wedding takes place stands as a symbol of the convergence of these two worlds, with its ancient stone walls echoing the traditions of the past while the modern hustle of the town outside signifies the relentless march of time. The natural environment, with its rolling hills and dense forests, acts as both a backdrop and a silent witness to the unfolding drama between Joseph and Nima.",
