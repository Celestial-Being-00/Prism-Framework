    "Central Conflict": "The central conflict is refined to revolve around the dissonance between ancient myth and modern reality, as well as the emotional tension between Emma and Jack. The unexpected summoning of Freya, who is nonchalant about her appearance in the modern world, creates a juxtaposition that challenges the researchers' understanding of their own lives and the boundaries between the mythic and the mundane. As Freya perceives the unacknowledged romantic tension between Emma and Jack, she becomes the catalyst for their emotional confrontation, leading to the core conflict of whether they can embrace their feelings amidst the backdrop of their professional and personal beliefs.",
    "Character Descriptions": "- **Emma**: A dedicated archaeologist with a fervent passion for ancient civilizations, Emma is intelligent, meticulous, and initially resistant to the idea of romantic involvement with her colleague, Jack.

He is practical, often burying his emotions beneath his professional aspirations. Jack's character is developed to show his internal conflict between career goals and the burgeoning love he feels for Emma, which he has yet to acknowledge.\n- **Freya**: Portrayed as a timeless figure, Freya embodies the essence of love and beauty. Her nonchalant attitude towards being summoned from her mythological realm is a central feature of her character. She is wise, having observed human love for centuries, and her interventions are subtle, revealing her deeper understanding of Emma and Jack's connection.",
    "Setting": "The setting is a quaint English suburb, providing a stark contrast to the grandeur of Freya's mythological origins. The suburb is vividly described with its cobblestone streets, centuries-old homes, and lush gardens, which serve as a backdrop for the merging of ancient myth and modern life. Freya's realm is only fleetingly described, but it is imbued with a sense of majesty and natural beauty that complements the modern setting, creating an ambiance where the extraordinary is made ordinary.",
